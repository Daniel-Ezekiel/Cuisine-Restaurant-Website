## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

By using HTML to build the structure abd layout of the webpage, using CSS to style the website was relatively easier and using a mobile first approach was quite convenient. JavaScript was used to build the hamburger menu style for the mobile versions of the website.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. This project helped me realise once again how imp0rtant separation of concerns is. I will also continually take the mobile first approach of web development anytime, especially when it comes to developing websites. It makes scaling up the website to fit the desktop view relatively easier.

## Examples:
